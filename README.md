# Language Detection SOC
This Language Detection model (using python) is used to predict text from images using EasyOCR and detect the language in which the text has been written


In Week 1, we studied about the basics of python language and the various libraries of python - the most important being pandas and numpy.

In Week 2, Machine Learning was introduced to us for the very first time. Its implementation was taught using techniques of Linear Regression, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes Classifier.

In Week 3, we learnt about the basics of Natural Language Processing and did various operations such as stemming, lemmatization using NLTK library and used the Naive Bayes Classifier to create a basic spam classifier.

In Week 4, We learnt about the Optical Character Recognition and used EasyOCR to extract text from various images.

In the final Week, we created the Language Detection model which could extract text from images using EasyOCR and predict their language.
